 +Persona Analysis<br>
 +
 +<h2> <center> Persona: Students</center></h2>
 +
 +
 +<p>Students may access this website for multiple reasons. One being that the student is a member of a team that is competing in the competition. The second reason would be that the student is interested in the competition and wants to go watch the business proposals. In terms of students on a team they would use the site in order to view their work and would want to stay up to date with the site to assure they are fully prepared for their proposals. Some of the things they would want to focus on are deadlines, events taking place, the twitter feed, and any scheduling updates that may take place. These students may also utilize the site in order to familiarize themselves with their mentors and advisers. Students participating in the competition may want to see who's judging the competition so that they can cater their proposals to their audience. The main objective for students like this is to stay up to date with everything and be aware of the schedule and any changes that may occur.</p>
 +<p>The site will be used differently by students who are not participating in the competition. Due to the amount of interest this competition has created in the past it is very probable that students not participating will have interest in what type of events are being held as well as when and where they will be held. These students may use these events as a way to network, determine if they have interest in competing in the future, show support to their friends in the competition, or use it to cater to their love for the business world.</p>
 +<p>Student's who show interest in the site will have different knowledge of the business world. For instance those involved in the StagUp competition will have more knowledge of the business world then the students who are using it as a learning experience, or to show support to their peers. For this reason the site must be easy to navigate as well as accessible for students of all levels. </p>
 +<p>The website will be displaying all of the StagUp events in order to create interest and draw students to attend. There will be several events all which lead up to the central event the StagUp Showcase. Students may be interested in attending all of the events, or just the main StagUp Showcase due to their involvement in the competition or their thirst for more business knowledge. In terms of accessibility a large majority of students utilize smartphones so it will be crucial that our website will be able to adapt effectively and efficiently to a mobile platform, so they are not restricted to the use of a computer to access the information.</p>

 +
 +<h2> <center> Persona: Investors </center></h2>
 +
 +<p>The audience the students participating in the StagUp competition will be looking to impress are a panel of Fairfield alumni, investors, and contractors. The investors are made up of wealthy businessmen who are looking to provide capital to promising start-ups. The investor will receive a share or whole ownership equity in return for their investment in the start-up. Similar to the students, it is imperative that the investors stay up to date with each facet of the StagUp program. Since the investors are potentially providing the funds for ether one or a few of the start-ups their involvement in the StagUp program is crucial. For this reason they must be informed of rules and regulations to ensure they do not break them, and the team they are trying to potentially fund is not breaking them as well. In addition they must be aware of the schedule of the presentations.  With out these businessmen the StagUp program is not as effective and enticing to join.</p>
 +<p>Businessman are some of the busiest people in the workforce so it is critical that the information they need is readily available and easy to navigate. We want the investors to be able to see everything they need to just by glancing at the site so one of the first things on the page should be the schedule of events.This will allow them to quickly know when and where events are being held. Similar to students many investors use mobile devices and are always on the go so the site needs to be compatible with a mobile platform to allow them an easy and hassle free experience.</p>
 +<p>Unlike students or faculty the investors won't be frequently checking the site. They are not as involved in the creation as the students or faculty so will likely only be checking the site when the competition is coming to a close, and they are more involved in the events. The investor are not likely to access the site as frequently as the students and faculty/mentors due to their lack of involvement with the creation process.</p>

 +<h2><center>Persona: Faculty/Mentors</center></h2>
 +
 +
 +<p>Part of what makes this competition so special are the connections groups make with advisors and mentors. These advisors and mentors are professionals who are willing to help teams make their business plans effective and professional. These users will need to stay up to date with the events in order to assure the team they are advising is prepared when the events take place. These mentors and advisers must also be able to familiarize themselves with the rules and regulations in order to make sure their team complies with all rules and to be able to assist them to the best of their ability. They may also find looking at previous winners business plans helpful. This way they can get a basis of what it takes to win, and what type of ideas have the best chance of winning. This will allow them to help their team come up with a winning business plan.  </p>
 +<p>Similar to the investors these users will have very busy schedules. For that reason the site must be easy to navigate with relevant information readily available in order for them to utilize their time with their teams efficiently. Again the site must be able to be viewed on a mobile platform to assure a positive experience and the flexibility to view the site remotely.</p>
 +<p>The mentors will likely want to be able to follow their team throughout the competition therefor the schedule must be easily accessible above the fold to allow for quick viewing. The advisors and mentors main purpose of viewing the site is to learn the rules and regulations,view the schedule, and learn any other information they feel will be helpful when mentoring their team. </p>
